# Daily Coding Problem

I have subscribed to the daily coding problem on: https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

My goal is to become a little better everyday at solving code challenges.

I could do them in TypeScript, since I'm very proficient in that language.
But I'm currently learning Ruby, so I want to stretch myself and do it in that language.

I'm very bad a Ruby for now, so expect the solutions to be really bad at first.

But I hope to become a little better everyday.

If you see ways in which I can improve my solutions, please provide feedback.

Thanks!
