# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
# And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square.
# Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle!
# Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦
# Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

# Task
# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer;
# in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

# Examples
# -1  =>  false
#  0  =>  true
#  3  =>  false
#  4  =>  true
# 25  =>  true
# 26  =>  false
